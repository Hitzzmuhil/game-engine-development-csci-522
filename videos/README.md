\### 1. Server-Based Asset Loading

🔗 https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qAsK\_JpdmFpW2dlvvk\_uHm8ubUNZoMAU/view?usp=drive\_link



\*\*Description:\*\*

This video demonstrates the implementation of server-based asset loading, where game assets are fetched from a remote HTTP server instead of the local disk. The engine sends HTTP GET requests to retrieve assets dynamically and loads them into memory buffers, enabling centralized asset management and seamless updates without redistributing local files.

\### 2. Soldier Waypoint AI \& Target Shooting

🔗 https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EgccneZigYqOT99IwtDd\_pyWGS8AFqhG/view?usp=drive\_link



\*\*Description:\*\*

This video showcases a simulation involving two soldiers:

\- Soldier 1 moves randomly between predefined waypoints, alternating between walking and running.

\- Soldier 2 continuously tracks Soldier 1 by rotating to face him and fires when the target is within range and line of sight.

The demo highlights waypoint navigation, randomized movement behavior, target tracking, and shooting logic.

\### 3. Navigation Mesh Pathfinding

🔗 https://drive.google.com/file/d/14OE-6SejBpaCIXMvFIVHHgIPLZULAEbg/view?usp=drive\_link



\*\*Description:\*\*

This video demonstrates NPC navigation using a custom navigation mesh. The system computes the shortest collision-free path and generates intermediate waypoints for smooth movement. The path is dynamically recalculated in real time when camera movement or obstacles affect navigation, ensuring adaptive and efficient NPC pathfinding.

\### 4. Frustum Culling with AABB

🔗 https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L5gMny40deFMyIcn\_BljgLFjrWs\_NoIq/view?usp=drive\_link



\*\*Description:\*\*

This video presents the implementation of frustum culling using Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABB). Objects outside the camera’s view frustum are culled to optimize rendering performance. Debug visualizations show bounding boxes and frustum planes to verify correct culling behavior.

\### 5. Debug Visualization \& Tools

🔗 https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZMHcTL5fuJURoRBQ\_e-fOz2Xp7u\_OcS7/view?usp=drive\_link



\*\*Description:\*\*

This video highlights debugging and visualization enhancements, including a persistent on-screen debug text overlay displaying the camera’s trailing state. The overlay dynamically adjusts its position to remain visible, providing clear real-time feedback and improving system transparency during gameplay and evaluation.

\### 6. Collision and Physics System

🔗 https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DTPGz5iqpjmWxfVHA6HwlP7AfJihdzp9/view?usp=drive\_link



\*\*Description:\*\*

This video demonstrates the collision and physics system implemented using a Physics Manager. Soldiers are enclosed within spherical bounding volumes, while static objects use Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes. The system performs collision detection, handles sliding along obstacles, and applies gravity by adjusting the soldier’s vertical position when not supported by a plane.
