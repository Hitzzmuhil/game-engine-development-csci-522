# \# Game Engine Systems – CSCI 522

# 

# This repository documents engine systems I implemented as part of USC's Game Engine Development course (CSCI 522).  

# \*\*Note:\*\* source code is not included due to course restrictions — these systems were built on top of a provided base engine.

# 

# \## Systems Implemented

# \- NPC AI \& waypoint navigation (randomized waypoints, target tracking). :contentReference\[oaicite:2]{index=2}  

# \- Navigation Mesh pathfinding with collision-free shortest paths and dynamic recalculation. :contentReference\[oaicite:3]{index=3}  

# \- Collision \& Physics Manager: sphere \& AABB bounding volumes, sliding collision response, gravity checks. :contentReference\[oaicite:4]{index=4}  

# \- Rendering optimization via AABB \& camera frustum culling. :contentReference\[oaicite:5]{index=5}  

# \- Server-based asset loading (HTTP-based retrieval). :contentReference\[oaicite:6]{index=6}  

# \- Debug visualization (DebugRenderer and runtime overlays). :contentReference\[oaicite:7]{index=7}

# 

# \## Highlights

# \- Collision-free NavMesh routing with evenly spaced waypoints and runtime path adjustments. :contentReference\[oaicite:8]{index=8}  

# \- Physics Manager enabling sliding along obstacles and robust gravity fallback behavior. :contentReference\[oaicite:9]{index=9}  

# \- Replaced disk-based asset loading with HTTP GET asset retrieval for scalable deployments. :contentReference\[oaicite:10]{index=10}
